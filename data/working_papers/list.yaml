  abstract: >
    Repurchase agreements (repos) are collateralized contracts often secured by government securities. However, even identical repo contracts can trade at different rates, and these rates only partially reflect changes in the central bank's deposit facility rate. Motivated by the fact that most repo participants trade bilaterally with dealers in the over-the-counter segment of repo markets, I develop a search-theoretic model that endogenously generates repo price distributions. A key insight is that it is not dispersion itself but the concentration of prices at the tails of the distribution that matters for central bank interventions. An increase in the deposit facility price has imperfect pass-through to repo prices, with pass-through weakening as the price rises and creating ambiguous effects on the composition of central bank liabilities. Both the central bank's borrowing and lending facilities resolve this ambiguity, but using the borrowing facility comes at the cost of raising inflation. In line with the Friedman rule, pegging the lending and deposit facility rates at the zero-lower bound achieves the most efficient use of money in exchange.

- title: "How Central Banks Should Use Their Balance Sheets to Control Flight-to-Safety"

  abstract: >
    I study how central banks should use their balance sheets to control flight-to-safety in a model with retail and wholesale banks, where the magnitude of flight-to-safety is endogenously determined by the severity of wholesale banking panics. I show that expanding the central bank's balance sheet, by purchasing government bonds through issuance of reserves, mitigates wholesale banking panics. However, this policy lowers asset returns, limiting the usefulness of assets in transactions, which harms depositors. Instead, swapping reserves for other central bank liabilities accessible to wholesale banks, for instance, through the U.S. Federal Reserve's overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility, mitigates panics without reducing asset returns or transactions. Critical for these results are endogenous shifts in asset demand. When central banks reduce the supply of safe government bonds to private markets, as in balance sheet expansions, there are large increases in the demand for private banks' liabilities which bid down their returns. Adjusting the composition of central bank liabilities avoids such large demand shifts.

- title: "Costly Liquidity Provision under Asymmetric Information"

  abstract: >
    I study the asymmetric information problem during financial crises and its implications for monetary policy. Specifically, banks offer liquidity insurance services to households, backed by their asset holdings.
    A low nominal interest rate policy not only promotes the issuance of bank loans but also reduces the opportunity cost of holding currency, improving banking services. However, I show that the costs associated with asymmetric information, captured by screening costs, can outweigh the benefits of a prosperous financial market. In such a scenario, the Friedman rule is not optimal, and the optimal nominal interest rate policy targets a high rate that shuts down the loan market. Finally, I propose a loan subsidy program to address the asymmetric information problem, under which the Friedman rule becomes optimal.
