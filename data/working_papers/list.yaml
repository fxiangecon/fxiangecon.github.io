    While financial arbitrage implies that repurchase agreements (repos) with the same collateral and maturity should trade at the same price, repo prices exhibit substantial dispersion.
    Moreover, repo prices respond only partially to changes in the central bank's deposit facility rate, raising concerns about monetary policy transmission.
    I develop a model in which search frictions in over-the-counter repo markets generate endogenous repo price dispersion and study the implications of this dispersion for monetary policy.
    The key insight is that what matters for policy is not the overall distribution of prices but their concentration in the tails --- monetary policy affects only one tail of repo prices, with the other being insensitive to policy.
    In this way, changes in the central bank's deposit facility rate exhibit imperfect pass-through, with the pass-through weakening as repo prices shift toward their insensitive tail.
    The central bank's lending and borrowing facilities mitigate imperfections in monetary policy transmission, but using the borrowing facility raises inflation.
    Consistent with the Friedman rule, pegging lending and deposit facility rates at the zero lower bound achieves efficiency.
  


- title: "How Central Banks Should Use Their Balance Sheets to Control Flight-to-Safety"

  abstract: >
    I study how central banks should use their balance sheets to control flight-to-safety in a model with retail and wholesale banks, where the magnitude of flight-to-safety is endogenously determined by the severity of wholesale banking panics.
    Expanding the central bank's balance sheet, through swaps of reserves for government bonds, mitigates wholesale banking panics.
    However, this policy lowers asset returns, limiting the usefulness of assets in transactions, which harms depositors.
    Instead, swapping reserves for other central bank liabilities accessible to wholesale banks mitigates panics without reducing asset returns or transactions.
    For example, the U.S. Federal Reserve's overnight reverse repurchase agreements serve this purpose. 
    Critical for these results are endogenous shifts in asset demand.
    When central banks reduce the supply of safe government bonds to private markets, as in balance sheet expansions, there are large increases in the demand for private banks' liabilities which bid down their returns. 
    Adjusting the composition of central bank liabilities avoids such large demand shifts.

    I study asymmetric information in bank lending and its implications for monetary policy.
    Banks lend against collateral but incur screening costs because households possess private information about collateral values.
    While loans entail screening costs, they are useful assets to back banks' liquidity insurance services, especially when safe assets, such as government bonds, are scarce.   
    Raising the nominal interest rate on bonds discourages lending and increases banks' opportunity cost of holding currency, thereby reducing banking services.
    Nevertheless, reduced lending saves on banks' screening costs.
    I show how these savings can outweigh the losses from reduced banking services, at least locally, when the nominal interest rate rises to the point that shuts down the loan market and eliminates the need for screening. 
    Moreover, such a high nominal interest rate can be globally optimal in situations where screening is particularly costly.
    In other words, the Friedman rule, which suggests a zero nominal interest rate, is not necessarily optimal. 
    Finally, I propose a loan subsidy program that eliminates screening costs, 
    under which the Friedman rule is optimal.
