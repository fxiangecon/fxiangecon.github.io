  #   The integration of renewable generation such as solar and wind is crucial to achieving decarbonization objectives. This paper provides a survey of engineering, economics, and policy challenges associated with this integration, focusing primarily on the dual problems of zero-marginal-cost generation and intermittency. From the engineering perspective, we describe challenges in the operation and planning stages of electric power systems faced with increasing renewable penetration. We review the economic challenges for restructured electricity markets and highlight important implications for energy policies designed to promote growth and spur innovation in the renewable energy sector. We argue that the engineering, economic, and policy aspects of managing zero-marginal-cost, intermittent renewable energy cannot be decoupled—these challenges are inexorably linked. Hence, we describe how these three fields must work together to understand the key interactions that will make the transition to a low-carbon energy landscape a success.


- title: "How Central Banks Should Use Their Balance Sheets to Control Flight-to-Safety"

  abstract: >
    I study how central banks should use their balance sheets to control flight-to-safety in a model with retail and wholesale banks, where the magnitude of flight-to-safety is endogenously determined by the severity of wholesale banking panics. I show that expanding the central bank's balance sheet, by purchasing government bonds through issuance of reserves, mitigates wholesale banking panics. However, this policy lowers asset returns, limiting the usefulness of assets in transactions, which harms depositors. Instead, swapping reserves for other central bank liabilities accessible to wholesale banks, for instance, through the U.S. Federal Reserve's overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility, mitigates panics without reducing asset returns or transactions. Critical for these results are endogenous shifts in asset demand. When central banks reduce the supply of safe government bonds to private markets, as in balance sheet expansions, there are large increases in the demand for private banks' liabilities which bid down their returns. Adjusting the composition of central bank liabilities avoids such large demand shifts.

- title: "Costly Liquidity Provision under Asymmetric Information"

  abstract: >
    I study the asymmetric information problem during financial crises and its implications for monetary policy. Specifically, banks offer liquidity insurance services to households, backed by their asset holdings.
    A low nominal interest rate policy not only promotes the issuance of bank loans but also reduces the opportunity cost of holding currency, improving banking services. However, I show that the costs associated with asymmetric information, captured by screening costs, can outweigh the benefits of a prosperous financial market. In such a scenario, the Friedman rule is not optimal, and the optimal nominal interest rate policy targets a high rate that shuts down the loan market. Finally, I propose a loan subsidy program to address the asymmetric information problem, under which the Friedman rule becomes optimal.
