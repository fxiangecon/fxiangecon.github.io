Welcome to my website! I am a PhD student at Georgia Institute of Technology, [School of Economics](https://econ.gatech.edu). 

I am an energy and environmental economist interested in examining the broad impact of climate change and energy transition using tools from applied microeconomics and industrial organizations. 

My current projects demonstrate how technology can address environmental challenges: I examine (i) how smart thermostat automation improves energy conservation during grid emergencies, and (ii) how individuals adjust their behavior to avoid pollution using physical activity data from wearable devices. In my ongoing work, I study the impact of battery storage deployment on renewable and conventional generators, specifically in Texas electricity markets.

Before Georgia Tech, I worked as an academic professional and consultant for various energy and environmental policy think tanks in Indonesia. I hold a B.S. and M.S. in Petroleum Engineering (specialization in Energy Economics and Policy) from [Institute of Technology Bandung](https://www.itb.ac.id/?n=1728695487), and a M.S. in Economics from Georgia Tech.
