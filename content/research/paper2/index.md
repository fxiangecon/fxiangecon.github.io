##### Abstract

A model is constructed to study the impact of adverse selection in financial markets on the efficiency of other markets. 
Private collateral provision matters for the transmission across markets. 
Adverse selection hinders collateral provision in the loan market, resulting in inefficiency in the goods market as collateral is essential to
secure credit transactions. 
Without further intervention, when the adverse selection problem is severe, the accommodative government policy may shut down the loan
market, even if it is feasible. 
A novel loan subsidy program is proposed, which works by addressing the adverse selection problem banks face.
