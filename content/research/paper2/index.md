summary: "Private collateral provision matters for the transmission across markets. 
Adverse selection hinders collateral provision in the loan market, resulting in inefficiency in the goods market as collateral is essential to secure credit transactions. 
The optimal interest rate policy may shut down the loan market entirely. 
A novel loan subsidy program is proposed to address banks' adverse selection problem."

##### Abstract

I study the asymmetric information problem during financial crises and its implications for monetary policy. 
Specifically, banks offer liquidity insurance services to households, backed by their asset holdings. 
A low nominal interest rate policy not only promotes the issuance of bank loans but also reduces the opportunity cost of holding currency, improving banking services. 
However, I show that the costs associated with asymmetric information, captured by screening costs, can outweigh the benefits of a prosperous financial market. 
In such a scenario, the Friedman rule is not optimal, and the optimal nominal interest rate policy targets a high rate that shuts down the loan market. 
Finally, I propose a loan subsidy program to address the asymmetric information problem, under which the Friedman rule becomes optimal.
