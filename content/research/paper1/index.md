##### Abstract

Repurchase agreements (repos) are collateralized contracts often fully secured by safe government securities. 
However, even identical contracts can trade at different rates, and the rates only partially reflect changes in the central bank’s deposit facility rate. 
Motivated by the fact that most repo participants trade bilaterally with dealers in the over-the-counter segment of repo markets, I develop a search-theoretic model that endogenously generates repo price dispersion and imperfect monetary policy pass-through. 
The deposit facility price can have ambiguous effects on the supply of central bank liabilities, and its pass-through to repo prices weakens as this price increases. 
Both the central bank’s borrowing and lending facilities eliminate this ambiguity, but using the borrowing one is at the cost of inflation. 
Consistent with the Friedman rule, pegging the lending and deposit rates at the zero-lower bound achieves the most efficient use of currency in exchange. 
Crucial for the results is not price dispersion itself, but the concentration of prices at the tails of the distribution.
