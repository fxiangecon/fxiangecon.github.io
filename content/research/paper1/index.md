summary: "Wholesale banking panics have driven several flight-to-safety events in recent decades, raising concerns over financial stability. I study such events using a model with retail and wholesale banks, where the severity of wholesale banking panics is endogenously determined and captures the magnitude of flight-to-safety. I show that expanding the central bank’s balance sheet mitigates wholesale banking panics, but doing so may reduce welfare by lowering returns on assets, thereby limiting their usefulness in transactions. However, expanding the reach of interest-bearing central bank liabilities to wholesale banks, which can be achieved through the U.S. Federal Reserve’s overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility, can mitigate panics without reducing welfare."

##### Abstract

Wholesale banking panics have driven several flight-to-safety events in recent decades, raising concerns over financial stability. I study such events using a model with retail and wholesale banks, where the severity of wholesale banking panics is endogenously determined and captures the magnitude of flight-to-safety. I show that expanding the central bank’s balance sheet mitigates wholesale banking panics, but doing so may reduce welfare by lowering returns on assets, thereby limiting their usefulness in transactions. However, expanding the reach of interest-bearing central bank liabilities to wholesale banks, which can be achieved through the U.S. Federal Reserve’s overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility, can mitigate panics without reducing welfare.
