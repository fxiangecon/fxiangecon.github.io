##### Abstract

Wholesale banking panics have driven several flight-to-safety events in recent decades, raising concerns over financial stability. I study such events using a model with retail and wholesale banks, where the severity of wholesale banking panics is endogenously determined and captures the magnitude of flight-to-safety. The central bank manages its balance sheet actively. Asset returns react endogenously to the central bank’s actions, influencing the usefulness of assets in transactions and, therefore, depositors’ demand for safe assets and bank deposits. I show that a central bank balance sheet expansion mitigates wholesale banking panics, but doing so may reduce welfare because it lowers asset returns, limiting the usefulness of assets in transactions. However, the central bank can mitigate wholesale banking panics and improve welfare by expanding the reach of its interest-bearing liabilities to wholesale banks, as in the case of the Fed’s overnight reserves repurchase agreements.
